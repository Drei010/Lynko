Project Title: LinkedIn AI Chat Assistant

Objective:
Develop a browser extension that acts as an AI-powered chat assistant. This tool will integrate with LinkedIn Messaging to analyze an active conversation in real-time and generate contextually appropriate replies on behalf of the user.

Core Functionality & User Workflow:

Activation:

The user (Human 1) must be logged into LinkedIn and navigate to the chat interface of the desired contact (Human 2).

The browser extension will inject a "Start AI Assistant" button within the LinkedIn messaging interface.

The user clicks this button to activate the assistant for that specific conversation.

Analysis:

Once activated, the AI must continuously monitor the conversation thread.

It will analyze the entire message history with Human 2 to understand context, tone, and the subject matter.

For each new message received from Human 2, the AI will process it to determine intent, sentiment, and key points that require a response.

Reply Generation:

Based on its analysis, the AI will generate a relevant, coherent, and professional reply.

The generated reply will be displayed to the user (Human 1) in a non-intrusive preview panel, not sent automatically.

User Control & Action:

The user can either:

Approve and Send: Click a "Send" button to post the AI-generated reply directly into the chat input box and send it.

Edit: Modify the suggested reply before sending.

Ignore/Discard: Dismiss the suggestion and type a manual response.

Technical Requirements:

Platform: Must function as a browser extension (e.g., for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

LinkedIn Integration: Must safely and reliably interact with the LinkedIn DOM to read messages and inject reply suggestions, adhering to LinkedIn's Terms of Service.

AI/NLP Engine: Integration with a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, or similar) for conversation analysis and text generation.

Data Handling: All message data must be processed securely. The user's conversation history should not be stored permanently without explicit consent.

Customization: The user should be able to set parameters for the AI, such as:

Response tone (e.g., Formal, Casual, Enthusiastic).

Response length.

Key objectives (e.g., "Schedule a meeting," "Learn more about X," "Be politely dismissive").

Key Features:

Real-time Analysis: The AI scans new messages instantly upon receipt.

Context-Awareness: Maintains the context of the entire conversation, not just the last message.

User-in-the-Loop: The user has final approval over all messages, ensuring control and authenticity.

Non-Intrusive UI: The extension's interface blends seamlessly with LinkedIn's native design.

Summary of Key Improvements:
Clarity & Grammar: Corrected spelling and grammatical errors for a professional tone.

Specificity: Defined the tool as a "browser extension" and specified its integration point ("injects a button").

Workflow Precision: Detailed the step-by-step process from activation to sending a message.

Crucial Safeguard: Added the essential "User-in-the-Loop" step where the user must approve messages before sending, preventing autonomous and potentially harmful communication.

Technical Depth: Outlined key technical requirements like platform, NLP engine, and data security.

Enhanced Features: Added concepts like tone customization and context-awareness to make the prompt more powerful and useful.
